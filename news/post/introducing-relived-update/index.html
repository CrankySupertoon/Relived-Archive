            <h4 style='font-size: 17px;'>Posted by: The Toontown Relived Team     on December 21, 2018 at 12:00 AM</h4>
            <hr class='major'>
            <div style='text-align: left;font-family: ImpressBT'>Whether you're a new Toon looking for a place to call home, or an existing one ready to get back to Cog busting, the time has 	finally come. <b>Toontown Relived has officially released the long-awaited 1.5 update!</b> So grab your gags, put a hat or some 	glasses on your Doodle, and buckle up! Because we've got a lot to cover.<div><img alt="" src="../../../static/blog/welcome-to-toontown.jpg"><br></div><div>For the past year, we've given you the surface of the latest update with Daily Challenges, new ToonTasks, 	and don't forget about a lot of improvements to the Toon Estate, but it's finally time to get into the nitty-gritty 	of those features and everything else this huge update includes!<h1>Daily Challenges</h1>         	<p>It's been so long since Aversive showed us Daily Challenges and we totally didn't stop there! 	From that point on, we had completely revamped the challenge system to make it wackier and fun for everyone (even us!). 	To accommodate for the difficulty of these challenges, <b>only Toons higher than 45 Laff Points can complete challenges</b>. 	Guess what, if you didn't notice <b>all challenges reset everyday at 2:00 AM Toontown Time (PST)</b>. You might be asking, 	"what's in it for me"? I asked myself the same thing! The Toon Resistance has driven a lot of those pesky Lawbot Field Offices 	out and we had more of the Cog's Sprockets than we knew what to do with! You can earn sprockets, named Emblems for your craving 	of wackiness, and buy prizes ranging from new houses for the Toon Estate, or even some <b>Doodle Accessories</b>! You heard me 	right! You can totally express your Doodle's personal style with a bunch of accessories.</p><p><img alt="" src="../../../static/blog/daily-challenges-release.png"><br></p><h1>The Story Conundrum</h1>        	 <p>After a boring business trip to Lawbot Headquarters for some legal interference, Lord Lowden Clear has come back to 	 Toontown and is offering <b>3 brand new ToonTasks</b> in Toon Hall! With Mata Hairy busy in Cashbot H.Q., and Good Ol' 	 Gil Giggles setting up an outpost in Donald's Dreamland, Lord Lowden Clear is in need of Toons who knows what it takes 	 to be a Resistance Ranger. Can you <b>figure out what big project the Cashbots are funding</b>, <b>investigate the mysterious 	 Broken Road</b>, or even <b>go fish for the rarest of them all</b>? Then you have what it takes to be a member of the Toon 	 Resistance!</p><p><img alt="" src="../../../static/blog/lowden-story-toontasks.png"><br></p><h1>Technical Improvements</h1>         <p>The Toon Council and our Top Toon Electricians have eased a whole bunch 	 of oil spills left by the Cogs. The pipes under Toon Hall have received a lot more attention than it was previously given. What 	 does this mean? Well, <b>the website features ways 	 to recover lost credentials</b>, <b>Toon name approval has been fully implemented</b>, and so much more! Did we mention that 	 <b>Toontown Relived now features Mac OSX support</b>?</p><p><img alt="" src="../../../static/blog/doodles-love-apples.png"><br></p><h1>What's in it for the future?</h1>         	 <p>While working on this update, we had a whole bunch of new ideas that we want to bring into fruition for the game. 	 It's only a matter of time before we reveal what's really going on behind the tunnel in Toontown Online and why the other Cog 	 branches haven't received Field Offices. We'd like to end off by thanking everyone who has previously been apart of Toontown 	 Relived's team and most importantly, <b>YOU</b> for sticking with us while making this update. We hope to be around a long time	 with a whole bunch of updates in between! So what are you waiting for, get online, grab some gags, and start exploring! This is 	 only the start of a brand new adventure and we'd love for you to be apart it.</p>         <br>       </div></div>
