            <div style='text-align: left;font-family: ImpressBT'><p>You know, every once in awhile we all need to appreciate the wonderful world we call home: Toontown Relived. I like to go into my Estate, curl up by the fireplace, dig up bones in Daisy&rsquo;s Garden (Sorry not sorry Daisy!), and of course stop those menacing Cogs! But above all else- my favorite part of Toontown Relived? That&rsquo;s easy.</p><p><span style="">Every second of every day&hellip; </span><span>YOU</span><span style=""> are the best part! As a member of the Toon Council, it is my job to not only be a friend to all--but to be a bridge between you and the rest of the Toontown Relived team. We want to give you the opportunity to add anything you want into Toontown! This could be anything from a feature, tweak, and anything in between! We want to hear your thoughts!</span></p><p><span style=""><img src="../../../static/blog/flippy-is-soaring.jpg" alt="" width="1919" height="978" /></span></p><p><a href="https://toontownrelived.com/game/suggestions" class="btn btn-block btn-purple btn-lg">Send in an idea!</a><br><span style="">All you have to do is click the button above, fill out the form, and be as descriptive as possible. As an example, if you wanted to add a new street to the game where would you put it? Would you add it to Goofy Speedway? Acorn Acres? What would the name be? Any specific cog types? Also- be sure to give us an idea of what you think it should look like! </span></p><p>Did I forget to mention something&hellip; I can&rsquo;t put my glove on it. YES! </span><span>The Top 5 suggestions will be featured in an upcoming update to Toontown Relived! <b>The contest ends April 1st at 11:59 P.M. Toontown Time (Pacific Standard Time).</b> What are you waiting for? Get creative, get excited, and get thinking! This is YOUR town! Please contact us on Discord or via email if you need assistance!&nbsp; Are YOU Toon Enough?!</p></div>
