Toontown, as a whole, is still growing day by day and we're sure that it's going to be like that for quite a while.<br><br>Just like before, the Toon Council has re-opened the Party Grounds with the help of the residents of Toontown. <b>Head over to the Party Gate in Toontown Central and walk into it to head to the Party Grounds!&nbsp;</b>Upon arriving, you'll immediately see that our own Toons have constructed a Trolley, dug a big hole for a fishing spot, and are even teaching the Toons new methods to dance!<br></p><p><img alt="" src="../../../static/blog/its_the_party_hat_again.jpg"><br>Don't forget to enter the code<b> "toontown-birthday-16"</b> to get your party hat. The fun doesn't stop here, Toons. While Toontown's birthday may only last one day, we're preserving the Party Grounds throughout the entire summer! The Toon Council already has brand new ideas for it coming in the following weeks.&nbsp;<b>Happy Birthday, Toontown!</b><br></p></div>
